# Dynamics-3R-manipulator
Calculate dynamics of a 3 link robot moving payload through different poses.

> Please define the link lengths and the the mass of the links in a 3R robot.
> When different poses through which the robot moves are defined, The matlab code calculates the path required to move through those poses and torque needed to be actuated by the servo motors.
